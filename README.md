NBPWebAPI-Vue
Just like my NBP Web API, but with Vue The app gets data from the api.nbp.pl service, that operates a public Web API.

Table A of the average foreign currency exchange rates is published (updated) on the NBP website on business days, between 11:45 a.m. and 12:15 p.m. Table B of the average foreign currency exchange rates is published (updated) on the NBP website on Wednesdays, between 11:45 a.m. and 12:15 p.m. If Wednesday is a bank holiday, the update takes place the previous day. Table C of the buy and sell prices of foreign currencies exchange rates and the table of units of account exchange rates are published (updated) on the NBP website on business days, between 7:45 a.m. and 8:15 a.m.

See: https://github.com/MarekZiemba/NBP-Web-API to compare how this code would change, had you not used React.
